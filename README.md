# Parsed CC-CEDICT

This project provides a parsed CSV version of CC-CEDICT from
https://cc-cedict.org so that software projects looking to use CEDICT do not
have to include their own parser.

To use CEDICT in your project, download the parsed CSV above.

# Todos

- Apply date and hash to dict.csv filename.
- Automate download, parsing, and pushing new release (if any updates) on a regular basis.
- Write documentation for consuming updates.
